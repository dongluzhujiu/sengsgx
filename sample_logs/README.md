## Sample Logs

This folder contains text files with console outputs of sample runs for each application.
All tests have been performed *locally* *without* switchless support, i.e., the results don't reflect actual benchmark results, but rather demonstrate the default behaviour.
The smaller TCP window size configuration has been used for the iPerf3 test to face less retransmissions (cf. note in iPerf3 guide and lwIP config).
The sample logs have been generated on a different (faster) machine than the benchmarks in the SENG paper (e.g., resulting in faster microbenchmark measurements).
