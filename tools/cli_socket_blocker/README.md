# Client Socket Blocker

Helper tool that is required for the automatic DNATing feature of the SENG server.
It has to be run on the client host which executes the shielded server app that
wants to listen on a socket.

More documentation will follow in the near future.

Note: currently build depends on mbedTLS source which will be updated in the
near future.
